# CPUScheduler
CS455 - CPUScheduler
Implementation of GA CPU Scheduler & tranditonal Schdeduler Algorithms

The main() function will be the entry of the program which will execute both GA Algorithm & Traditional CPU Scheduling Algorithms(Round Robin, FCFS, SRT, SJF)
and will calculate the fitness of solutions to see which one has the best overall performance.
To execute the program, we just need to run the main() class in the program.
